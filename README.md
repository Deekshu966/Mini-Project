# Mini-Project
EMPTY PARKING SPOT DETECTION USING KERAS,OPENCV AND CNN
# This project aims to detect parking slots and identify empty parking spots using image processing techniques and machine learning models. The project utilizes OpenCV for image processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification, and Keras as the deep learning framework.
# Navigate to the project directory:
# cd parking_slot_detection
# step 1:
python ImageProcessing.py
# step 2:
python parkingspotcoordinate.py
# step 3:
python emptyparkingspotdetectionmodel.py

# step 4:
python emptyparkingspotdetection.py
